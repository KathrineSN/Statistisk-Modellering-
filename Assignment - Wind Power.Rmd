*** Descriptive statistics ***

# 1. Read the data tuno.txt into R.
```{r}
data <- read.delim("tuno.txt",header = TRUE, sep = " ", dec = ".")
head(data,6)
```


# 2. Make a graphical presentation of data or parts of the data, and present some summary statistics.

# Summary statistics:
```{r}

summary(data[c(0,4:6)],digits = 2)

```

#Graphical presentation:


```{r}
library(ggpubr)
gghistogram(data, x = "pow.obs", bins = 15, 
             add = "mean")
```


```{r}
# Are some months on average more windy?
library(tidyverse)

mean_by_month <- data %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(averaged.power = mean(pow.obs))

plot(mean_by_month)
```

```{r}
#does a high prediction equal a high production?
# Indeed yes!
plot(data$ws30,data$pow.obs)
```
